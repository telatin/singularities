# Install Singularity

```note
For security reasons it's recommended to install an updated release of Singularity.
But, since newer releases are capable of executing images generated by previous ones,
but not vice versa, our recipes here have been generated using an older version.
```

## What version
Some HPC clusters still provide an outdated version of [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/),
while it's tempting to install the latest version (currently [3.7](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.7/user-guide))
when installing it into a Virtual Machine (VM).

In this repository we describe definition files that have been tested with
**Singularity 2.4.2**. The oldest version that is documented in the offical
website is 2.5, so also that version has been tested for some containers.
